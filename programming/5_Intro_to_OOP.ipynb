    "**Object-oriented programming (OOP)** is a way of writing code using \"objects\". Computer programs that are not object-oriented are a list of instructions for the computer, which is called procedural programming. In OOP computer programs use objects that talk to one another to change the data in those objects and to work the way the user wants. OOP allows code reusability, in different parts of the program or by different developers.\n",
