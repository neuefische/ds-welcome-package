    "But before we start dealing with functions let’s digress briefly into the world of **programming paradigms**. Programming paradigms are a way to classify programming languages based on their features like concepts, values and practices. Different paradigms often have varying ways of writing programs and thinking about them. There is a plethora of different paradigms and most languages can be classified into multiple of them. When you are new to programming you don’t have to worry much about those paradigms, but when you start to write complex programs or software it’s important to ponder and choose the one that best suits your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point we want to briefly introduce one paradigm called **procedural programming**, which is the one paradigm which most of the new programmers will (unconsciously) start with. In simple terms, procedural code is a concatenation of step-by-step instructions to tell the computer how to solve a specific task. When using procedural programming the code is divided into several procedures, also known as routines or **functions**, which will contain the single steps to be carried out. \n",
