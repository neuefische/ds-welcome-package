# ds-welcome-package
In order to have a common starting point it is important that you know both some basic statistics and some fundamentals about python programming. In this repository we will cover the general concepts that you should be familiar with before the start of the bootcamp. You do not need to install anything on your computer in order to work with the metarial, all material is browser based and we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Before you start

If you are not familiar with Google Colab, please start with [Intro to Colab notebook](Intro_to_Colab.ipynb) which shows you how to work with Colab.

We are covering two aspects: python programming and statistics (also with python). In case you are not familiar with the following concepts please following the codealongs and reading material.

## The fundamentals of python programming you should know:
- [Variables and types](programming/1_Python_Variables_Types.ipynb)
- [If/then/else and for loops](programming/2_Python_If_Else_Loops.ipynb)
- [Dictionaries, Lists, Arrays](programming/3_Python_Lists_Sets_Dictionaries.ipynb)
- [How to write a function, function arguments and so on](programming/4_Python_Functions.ipynb)
- [Object-oriented programming](programming/5_Intro_to_OOP.ipynb)
- [Read/write to and from files](programming/6_Read_Write_Files.ipynb)
  
Do not forget, programming is a skill that gets better with practice, if this is your first time with python, you might need repetition. And we will practice this!

## The basic statistics expectations we have of you are:
- [Random variables, Mean and medians, Variance and Standard deviation](statistics/1-Random-Variables-Mean-Median-Variance.ipynb)
- [Probability, Bayesâ€™ Theorem, Probability distribution](statistics/2-Probability.ipynb)
- [Hypothesis testing](statistics/3-Hypothesis-Testing.ipynb) 
- [Law of large numbers](statistics/4-Law-of-Large-Numbers.ipynb)

Some of the material is at a very basic level, where applicable we have extra reading material, you should only go to through the extras once you are done with the main material.


Thank you for going through the material! 
Hope you had fun.
