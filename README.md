# ds-welcome-package
In order to have a common starting point it is important that you know both some basic statistics and some fundamentals about python programming. In this repository we will cover the general concepts that you should be familiar with before the start of the bootcamp. You do not need to install anything on your computer in order to work with the metarial, all material is browser based and we will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

### Before you start

If you are not familiar with Google Colab, please start with [this notebook](Intro_to_Colab.ipynb) which shows you how to work with Colab.

We are covering two aspects: python programming and statistics (also with python). In case you are not familiar with the following concepts please following the codealongs and reading material.

## The fundamentals of python programming you should know:
- [Variables and types](1_Python_Variables_Types.ipynb)
- If/then/else and for loops
- Dictionaries, Lists, Arrays
- How to write a function, function arguments and so on
- [Object-oriented programming](programming/5_Intro_to_OOP.ipynb)
- Read/write toa and from files
  
Do not forget, programming is a skill that gets better with practice, if this is your first time with python, you might need repetition.

## The basic statistics expectations we have of you are:
- Random variables,
- Mean and medians
- Variance, autocovariance and autocorrelation
- Variance of a sum of random variables
- Probability, conditional probability and Bayesâ€™ Theorem
- Statistical independence, law of total probability and chain rule of probability
- Probability distribution and density function
- Hypothesis testing 
- Law of large numbers

Some of the material is at a very basic level, where applicable we have extra reading material, you should only go to through the extras once you are done with the main material.


## The moment of truth!

Working in data science means also evaluating performance. Why not do the same with ourselves.
In order to check your current knowledge on programming and statistics take this [quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/19KeSS1jeObxPB2-XhGBnbyg9wyb-aNaqIeBmhADVCd0/edit)
