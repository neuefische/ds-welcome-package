    "## Hypothesis testing \n",
    "\n",
    "A statistical hypothesis is a hypothesis that is testable on the basis of observed data modelled as the realised values taken by a collection of random variables. A set of data is modelled as being realised values of a collection of random variables having a joint probability distribution in some set of possible joint distributions. The hypothesis being tested is exactly that set of possible probability distributions. A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference. An alternative hypothesis is proposed for the probability distribution of the data, either explicitly or only informally. The comparison of the two models is deemed statistically significant if, according to a threshold probability -- the significance level -- the data is very unlikely to have occurred under the null hypothesis. A hypothesis test specifies which outcomes of a study may lead to a rejection of the null hypothesis at a pre-specified level of significance, while using a pre-chosen measure of deviation from that hypothesis (the test statistic, or goodness-of-fit measure). The pre-chosen level of significance is the maximal allowed \"false positive rate\". One wants to control the risk of incorrectly rejecting a true null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of distinguishing between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is aided by considering two conceptual types of errors. The first type of error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly rejected. The second type of error occurs when the null hypothesis is wrongly not rejected. (The two types are known as type 1 and type 2 errors.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis is an educated guess about something in the world around you. It should be testable, either by experiment or observation. For example:\n",
    "A new medicine you think might work.\n",
    "A way of teaching you think might be better.\n",
    "A possible location of new species.\n",
    "A fairer way to administer standardized tests.\n",
    "It can really be anything at all as long as you can put it to the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a Hypothesis Statement?**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are going to propose a hypothesis, it’s customary to write a statement. Your statement will look like this:\n",
    "“If I…(do this to an independent variable)….then (this will happen to the dependent variable).”\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "If I (decrease the amount of water given to herbs) then (the herbs will increase in size).\n",
    "If I (give patients counseling in addition to medication) then (their overall depression scale will decrease).\n",
    "If I (give exams at noon instead of 7) then (student test scores will improve).\n",
    "If I (look in this certain location) then (I am more likely to find new species).\n",
    "A good hypothesis statement should:\n",
    "\n",
    "Include an “if” and “then” statement (according to the University of California).\n",
    "Include both the independent and dependent variables.\n",
    "Be testable by experiment, survey or other scientifically sound technique.\n",
    "Be based on information in prior research (either yours or someone else’s).\n",
    "Have design criteria (for engineering or programming projects).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the Null Hypothesis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "In inferential statistics, the null hypothesis is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups\n",
    "In other words it is a basic assumption or made based on domain or problem knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : a company production is = 50 unit/per day etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative hypothesis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The alternative hypothesis is the hypothesis used in hypothesis testing that is contrary to the null hypothesis. It is usually taken to be that the observations are the result of a real effect (with some amount of chance variation superposed)\n",

    "**What is Hypothesis Testing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results. You’re basically testing whether your results are valid by figuring out the odds that your results have happened by chance. If your results may have happened by chance, the experiment won’t be repeatable and so has little use. So a hypothesis test evaluates two mutually exclusive statements about a population to determine which statement is best supported by the sample data. When we say that a finding is statistically significant, it’s thanks to a hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing can be one of the most confusing aspects for students, mostly because before you can even perform a test, you have to know what your null hypothesis is. Often, those tricky word problems that you are faced with can be difficult to decipher. But it’s easier than you think; all you need to do is:\n",
    "\n",
