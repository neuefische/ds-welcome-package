    "## Random variables\n",

In that context, a random variable is understood as a measurable function defined on a probability space that maps from the sample space to the real numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable is a measurable function $X\\colon \\Omega \\to E$ from a set of possible outcomes $\\Omega$  to a measurable space $E$. The technical axiomatic definition requires $\\Omega$ to be a sample space of a probability triple $(\\Omega ,{\\mathcal {F}},\\operatorname P)$. A random variable is often denoted by capital roman letters such as $X, Y, Z, T$.\n",

    "## Mean, Median, Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean\n",
    "There are several kinds of mean in mathematics, especially in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also called the expected value or average, is the central value of a discrete set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers $x1, x2, ..., xn$ is typically denoted by $ \\bar x$. If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean (denoted $\\bar x$) to distinguish it from the mean of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted $\\mu$ or $\\mu_{x}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In probability and statistics, the population mean, or expected value, is a measure of the central tendency either of a probability distribution or of the random variable characterized by that distribution. In a discrete probability distribution of a random variable X, the mean is equal to the sum over every possible value weighted by the probability of that value; that is, it is computed by taking the product of each possible value x of X and its probability p(x), and then adding all these products together, giving $\\mu =\\sum xp(x)....$ An analogous formula applies to the case of a continuous probability distribution. Not every probability distribution has a defined mean (see the Cauchy distribution for an example). Moreover, the mean can be infinite for some distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a finite population, the population mean of a property is equal to the arithmetic mean of the given property, while considering every member of the population. For example, the population mean height is equal to the sum of the heights of every individual—divided by the total number of individuals. The sample mean may differ from the population mean, especially for small samples. The law of large numbers states that the larger the size of the sample, the more likely it is that the sample mean will be close to the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Arithmetic Mean (AM)\n",
    "Main article: Arithmetic mean\n",
    "The arithmetic mean (or simply mean) of a list of numbers, is the sum of all of the numbers divided by the amount of numbers. Similarly, the mean of a sample $x_{1},x_{2},\\ldots ,x_{n}$, usually denoted by $\\bar x$, is the sum of the sampled values divided by the number of items in the sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\bar x = \\frac {1}{n} (\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i})= \\frac {x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots +x_{n}}{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the arithmetic mean of five values: 4, 36, 45, 50, 75 is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac {4+36+45+50+75}{5}=\\frac {210}{5}=42$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Median\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics and probability theory, a median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample, a population, or a probability distribution. For a data set, it may be thought of as \"the middle\" value. The basic advantage of the median in describing data compared to the mean (often simply described as the \"average\") is that it is not skewed so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values, and so it may give a better idea of a \"typical\" value. For example, in understanding statistics like household income or assets, which vary greatly, the mean may be skewed by a small number of extremely high or low values. Median income, for example, may be a better way to suggest what a \"typical\" income is. Because of this, the median is of central importance in robust statistics, as it is the most resistant statistic, having a breakdown point of 50%: so long as no more than half the data are contaminated, the median will not give an arbitrarily large or small result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The median of a finite list of numbers is the \"middle\" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an odd number of observations, the middle one is picked. For example, consider the list of numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1, 3, 3, **6**, 7, 8, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "This list contains seven numbers. The median is the fourth of them, which is 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, for a set $x$ of $n$ elements, this can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$median (x)=x_{(n+1)/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If there is an even number of observations, then there is no single middle value; the median is then usually defined to be the mean of the two middle values.For example, in the data set\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1, 2, 3, **4**, **5**, 6, 8, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "The median is the mean of the middle two numbers: this is $\\frac {(4+5)}{2}$, which is $4.5$. (In more technical terms, this interprets the median as the fully trimmed mid-range). With this convention, the median can be described in a formula as follows (for **even** number of observations):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$median (x)= \\frac {x_{n/2}+x_{n/2+1}}{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data values. If X is a discrete random variable, the mode is the value x (i.e, **X** = x) at which the probability mass function takes its maximum value. In other words, it is the value that is most likely to be sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the statistical mean and median, the mode is a way of expressing, in a (usually) single number, important information about a random variable or a population. The numerical value of the mode is the same as that of the mean and median in a normal distribution, and it may be very different in highly skewed distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode is not necessarily unique to a given discrete distribution, since the probability mass function may take the same maximum value at several points x1, x2, etc. The most extreme case occurs in uniform distributions, where all values occur equally frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mode of a sample is the element that occurs most often in the collection. For example, the mode of the sample [1, 3, 6, 6, 6, 6, 7, 7, 12, 12, 17] is 6. Given the list of data [1, 1, 2, 4, 4] the mode is not unique – the dataset may be said to be bimodal, while a set with more than two modes may be described as multimodal."

    "## Variance, Autocovariance and Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variance\n",
    "In probability theory and statistics, variance is the expectation of the squared deviation of a random variable from its mean. Informally, it measures how far a set of numbers is spread out from their average value. Variance has a central role in statistics, where some ideas that use it include descriptive statistics, statistical inference, hypothesis testing, goodness of fit, and Monte Carlo sampling. Variance is an important tool in the sciences, where statistical analysis of data is common. The variance is the square of the standard deviation, the second central moment of a distribution, and the covariance of the random variable with itself, and it is often represented by $ \\sigma ^{2}, s^{2}$, or $\\operatorname {Var} (X)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $X$ with a finite or countably infinite range of values $\\mathcal {T}=\\{x_{1}, x_{2},\\dotsc ,x_{k},\\dotsc \\}$ is called discrete. Its variance is then calculated as the weighted sum of the squares of deviations (from the expected value):\n",

    "$$\\sigma^{2} = (x_1 - \\mu)^{2} p_1 + (x_2 - \\mu)^{2} p_2 + \\dotsc + (x_k - \\mu)^{2} p_k + \\dotsc = \\sum_{i \\geq 1} x_i p_i $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $ p_{i}=P(X=x_{i})$ is the probability that $X$ takes the value $x_{i}$. Thus, in the above sum, each possible expression $(x_{i}-\\mu )^{2}$ is weighted by the probability of its occurrence $p_{i}$. Thus, for discrete random variables, the variance is a weighted sum with the weights $ p_{i} \\;(i=1,\\ldots ,n)$. The expected value of a discrete random variable $X$ also represents a weighted sum given by\n",

    "$$ \\mu =x_{1}p_{1}+x_{2}p_{2}+\\ldots +x_{k}p_{k}+\\ldots =\\sum _{i\\geq 1}x_{i}p_{i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In statistics, variance measures variability from the average or mean. It is calculated by taking the differences between each number in the data set and the mean, then squaring the differences to make them positive, and finally dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values in the data set.\n",

    "\n",
    "Variance is calculated using the following formula:\n",

    "### Autocorrelation\n",
    "\n",
    "Autocorrelation, also known as serial correlation, is the correlation of a signal with a delayed copy of itself as a function of delay. Informally, it is the similarity between observations as a function of the time lag between them. The analysis of autocorrelation is a mathematical tool for finding repeating patterns, such as the presence of a periodic signal obscured by noise, or identifying the missing fundamental frequency in a signal implied by its harmonic frequencies. It is often used in signal processing for analyzing functions or series of values, such as time domain signals."
